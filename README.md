# Increased Maxplayers Bot Fix

If you are using an increased amount of maxplayers on your server and attempt to add more than 32 bots on the server you will quickly notice that a big portion of the bots are not spawned due to an "HandleCommand_JoinClass( undefined ) - invalid class name" error. This plugin fixes this so you can have more than 32 bots on your server.
